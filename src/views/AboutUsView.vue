    <p>
      There are shoes that look good; and then there are shoes that make you look and feel on top of
      your game. If you’re wondering, Everbest is all about the second kind. That is why we never
      stop sourcing for the best materials and perfecting the fit of our shoes, even as our
      designers curate the latest trends. So that when you slip on a pair, you know they are
      keepers.

    <p>
      Since 1979 our founding idea of making high quality, well-designed shoes that everyone could
      afford to own has resonated with people all across Asia. One of our strongly held beliefs is
      that durable and timeless elegance is the key to sustainable and stylish living. That is why
      our renowned quality, comfort and fit is cherished across generations. Today, as the call for
      sustainability grows, our way of doing things is more relevant than ever.

          At Everbest, we value our people and our ties with the greater community. Besides regular
          training programs to help our staff improve and grow as individuals and as a team, we also
          give back wholeheartedly by organizing annual charity drives and partnering with various
          humanitarian organizations as our beneficiaries.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2016, we unveiled Everbest Care Foundation, an Indonesia-based, non-profit
          organization. The foundation supports and partners with reputable humanitarian
          organizations by donating funds and sponsoring programs that support quality education and
          community development.

        <p>
          Looking ahead, Everbest will continue to adopt and develop new ways to source, design and
          produce our goods in a responsible and sustainable manner. For those who share in the
          desire for better and more meaningful things in life, we are with you every step of the
          way.
